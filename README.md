# ComputercraftCode

This is a collection of lua code I use for computercraft and CC:Tweaked purposes, including my sorting system and hopefully eventually a storage/retrieval/crafting system. No guarantees on anything (although I do reccomend Plus) the only reason why I'm making this public is so it's easier to import to the turtles!


I've found this is a useful repo to use to get it on the turtles: https://github.com/eric-wieser/computercraft-github
That can be installed with: pastebin run p8PJVxC4
